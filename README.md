# Multiclass classification problem- Flowers images
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/flower-classification/code) contains images of 14 different flowers. The repository contains the solution to the multiclass calssification problem. <br>
The explored strategies to solve it are: fine-tuning of a pretrained network, ResNet18, (optimal strategy) and building a CNN from scratch (didactic aim). Regarding hyperparameters tuning, raytune has been used to implement an optimized cross validation using asynchronous successive halving algorithm.
